# Webdev Project 011

This repo contains code to practice Redux.\
In the future, should also learn what is Redux-thunk and Redux-saga.

Data flow:

- create actions that returns obj with type and payload -> bind actions to elements using useDispatch
- create reducers that handles how states in Redux store changed based on actions -> bind all reducers to the store when start creating it -> wrap the app inside Provider so that anywhere can access it
